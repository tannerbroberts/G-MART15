 *   - Create a vite app with react and typescript and SWC
 *   - The vite app should be able to compile typescript code and place it in the /dist folder, ready to be served by the express server.
 *   - The "start" command, after setting this up, should run both the vite dev server (compiling the typescript code) and this express server on two different ports.
 *   - The "/" route should serve the compiled react app code, meaning we can see the same client, React app in the browser by going to localhost:3000 or localhost:5173 (vite default port)

/**
 * Story 3 (spike): Determine game rules
 *   - Estimate: 4, 5, 6: 15 / 3 = 5 hour estimate
 *   - Assignee: Georgia
 *   - Start time: Today, April 7th, 2025, 7:00 PM
 *   - Own and propose a single set of game rules, for which the assignee will be held responsible in terms of future specifications (tell us how the game works, and what the benefits are)
 *   - The rules should be easy to extend on (balatro, as an example)
 *   - The rules should be easy to implement
 *   - The rules should be generous in terms of counting cards, but not so generous as to be unreasonable or unrealistic
 *   - What are the game rules?
 *   - What are the rules for the dealer?
 *   - What are the rules for the player?
 *   - Can the player double down?
 *   - Can the player split?
 *   - Can the player surrender?
 *   - Can the player hit?
 *   - Can the player stand?
 *   - Can the player bet?
 *   - Can the player go bust?
 *   - Can the player win?
 *   - Can the player lose?
 *   - Can the player tie?
 *   - Can the player push?
 *   - Can the player get blackjack?
 *   - Can the player get 21?
 *   - What are the winnings for a bet?
 *   - What is the table limit?
 *   - What is the table minimum? (give numbers to show the results)
 *   - The team does not need to agree to use this proposal in it's entirety, but it will be used as a starting point for the game rules,
 * and to the extent that these rules ARE used, the assignee must be able to explain the rules and the reasoning behind them.
